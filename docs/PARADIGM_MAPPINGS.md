# Cross-Paradigm Concept Mappings

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive reference for the concept mappings used by TraceMineralDiscoveryAgent to translate medical concepts across paradigms.

### Purpose

Cross-paradigm mapping enables:
- **Unified research queries** across traditions
- **Hypothesis validation** from multiple perspectives
- **Translation** of findings for different audiences
- **Identification** of convergent evidence

### Epistemological Considerations

Each medical paradigm has its own:
- Ontology (what exists)
- Methodology (how we know)
- Teleology (what health means)

Mappings are functional equivalences, not exact translations. A TCM concept like "Kidney Yang" is not reducible to "thyroid function" - they overlap but are not identical.

## Confidence Scoring

| Score | Meaning | Criteria |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **High (85%+)** | Strong functional equivalence | Multiple research studies, clinical correlation, expert consensus |
| **Medium (60-84%)** | Moderate equivalence | Some research support, clinical observation, reasonable inference |
| **Low (< 60%)** | Theoretical equivalence | Limited research, conceptual reasoning only |

## Mapping Methodology

### Literature Review Process

1. **Source identification**: Classical texts, modern research, clinical guidelines
2. **Concept extraction**: Key terms and their definitions in each paradigm
3. **Functional analysis**: What does this concept do/explain?
4. **Clinical correlation**: How does it manifest in patients?
5. **Expert validation**: Review by practitioners of each tradition

### Confidence Assignment Criteria

**High Confidence (85%+)**
- Multiple peer-reviewed studies supporting correlation
- Clinical outcome data showing parallel effects
- Expert consensus across traditions
- Mechanism plausibility established

**Medium Confidence (60-84%)**
- Limited but supportive research
- Clinical observation without controlled studies
- Expert opinion supporting correlation
- Reasonable mechanistic inference

**Low Confidence (< 60%)**
- Theoretical correlation only
- No direct research support
- Expert disagreement
- Speculative mechanism

## Limitations

### Context Dependency

Mappings may not apply universally:
- Individual constitution affects concept relevance
- Acute vs. chronic presentations differ
- Concurrent conditions modify interpretation

### Reductionism Risk

Mapping traditional concepts to biomedical terms risks:
- Losing holistic context
- Over-simplifying complex patterns
- Missing paradigm-specific insights

### Dynamic Nature

Traditional medicine concepts are:
- Pattern-based, not static diagnoses
- Context-dependent
- Individual-specific

Mappings represent general tendencies, not rules.

### Cultural Context

Traditional medicine developed in specific cultural contexts:
- Diet, climate, lifestyle factors differ
- Modern applications may need adaptation
- Original texts assume traditional lifestyle

## Usage Guidelines

### For Research

1. Use mappings to identify parallel literature searches
2. Consider confidence scores when weighting evidence
3. Report paradigm-specific findings separately before synthesis
4. Acknowledge mapping limitations in reports

### For Clinical Application

1. **Never** use mappings as sole basis for treatment
2. Consult qualified practitioners in each tradition
3. Consider individual constitution and context
4. Use mappings for communication, not prescription

### For Product Development

1. Mappings support marketing claims alignment
2. Ensure regulatory compliance in each market
3. Traditional use claims require appropriate evidence
4. Safety data from all relevant paradigms
