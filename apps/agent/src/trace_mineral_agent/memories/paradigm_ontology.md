## Confidence Scoring Methodology

- **High (85%+):** Multiple research studies support equivalence; widely accepted
- **Medium (60-84%):** Some research support; clinical correlation observed
- **Low (< 60%):** Theoretical equivalence; limited research validation

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Research:** Use mappings to search across paradigm-specific databases
2. **Synthesis:** Identify convergent evidence for hypothesis validation
3. **Translation:** Help stakeholders understand cross-paradigm findings
4. **Caution:** Mappings are approximations; paradigms have distinct epistemologies
